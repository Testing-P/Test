# Summary of what's new in Finance and Operations

This topic lists the features that are planned for release in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations between October 2018 and March 2019. These release notes describe functionality that might not have been released yet. Delivery timelines might change, and projected functionality might change or might not be released (see [Microsoft policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007332)).

When a month is used in the **Date** column, the feature will be delivered sometime within that month. The delivery date can be any day within that month, not just on the first day of the month.
	
For a list of the regions where Dynamics 365 business applications are available, see the [International availability guide](https://aka.ms/dynamics_365_international_availability_deck).

> [!Note]
> Finance and Operations can be deployed in the cloud or on-premises. The following tables indicate whether a feature can be used in cloud environments, on-premises environments, or both. Keep in mind that the cloud and on-premises releases of a specific version of Finance and Operations may not be available at the same time. The on-premises release of a specific version is most often available shortly after the cloud release of the same version.
